JC Santamria Personal Statement

My personal mission is to be the best possible version of myself through the constant accumulation of the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to foster my intellectual advancement and intrapersonal growth. I strive to wake up each morning a better person than who I was the night before, with each succeeding day setting higher and higher standards for me to surpass. It is only through this endless pursuit of perfection within myself that I can begin to enact a positive transformation in the world around me. To complement my personal mission, I shall also abide by these codes of conduct:

Since a chain is only as good as its weakest link, I will strive to identify my shortcomings and work to improve upon them.

When provided with two paths, I will always choose the path that brings me closer to my goals and to the person I want to become.

I will never underestimate anyone because there is always something that I can learn from the people around me.

I will never be perfect, therefore there will always be a way that I can improve.

I will always carry myself with the utmost professionalism in both action and appearance.

I will always work twice as hard as my competition.

I will never act with malicious intent.

Above all else, I will never, under any circumstances, abandon my moral code of ethics and do anything deemed unjust, regardless of the potential benefit.
